1. Follow the formats below to create new shape:
triangle <vertice1.x> <vertice1.y> <vertice2.x> <vertice2.y> <vertice3.x> <vertice3.y>
donut <centr.x> <centr.y> <inner radius> <outer radius>
circle <centr.x> <centr.y> <radius>

Or you can input: help <shape name> to show the only instruction of a shape.
    For example: help circle

2. Use 'find <shape name>' to find the created shape
   Use 'delete <shape name>' to delete the created shape
